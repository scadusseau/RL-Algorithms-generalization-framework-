# RL-Algorithms-generalization-framework-
2 different environments with their datasets, and a code combining those environments

These codes illustrate the work done and described in the technical report. The authors of this report are V. Canipel and S. Cadusseau.
Here we implemented two different RL environments, running with a same agent. You will find those environments in separated files (Project cat and FIFA Project), and gathered in a third file (Test Emballage), that corresponds to our methods to generalize RL environment.

In order to make those environments work, you will need to download their respective datasets.
